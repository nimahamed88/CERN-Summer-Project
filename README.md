# Top-quark plus J/psi production from double parton scatterings in pp collisions at CMS

Project proposal:
The project aims at estimating the possibility to observe the production of a top-quark plus a J/psi meson from double parton scatterings (DPS) in pp collisions at the LHC. The student will compare the expected DPS cross section to those from the background single-parton scattering (SPS) processes (top-quark plus charm-quark, and top-quark plus bottom quark, with prompt and nonprompt J/psi production) and estimate the kinematical cuts needed to remove the SPS contributions.
